// final draft //
## Algorithm

include the io and random libraries

declare the constants

declare the function prototypes, the given 3 functions

### begin with function1, advance 

using std random statement given, generate 2 options for random numbers
like tossing a coin.
if the coin if 1, horse moves.

### begin with function 2 to print
use for loop, till the length of race track length and ++ it 
  print . unless(=using if) there is a the loop control variable is at where the horse supposed to be.

### begin function 3 to check if any horse(s) is a winner
this works to check if 1 or more horses wins at the same time like a case of tie.
  check if the horse is at a length more than the racetrack length(constant)
   if yes, print the output of winner
the return type will be a boolean

### main function
initialise the array
print a greeting, print the current default position of the horses, print a msg that race is beginning

declare a true boolean variable
begin the while loop
  begin with a loop that advances the horses and prints their position then

  another loop to check the if any horse has won or not

  print the "enter for another turn" statement 
  get input using get(), to get the enter key from user, widely used for interaction with user or get a single character input

  end the loop
return 0 to ensure everything is running smoothly 
end main!!





## Learning output :tada:
- [x] Learnt some basics of C++
- [x] Enjoyed experimenting so much with many failing programs
- [x] Did the project.
